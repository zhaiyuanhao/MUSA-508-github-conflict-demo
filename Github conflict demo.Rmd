## Setup 
Hey, this is my clone version of this repo!

First let's set up our chunk options and required libraries. This will minimize clutter and remove unnecessary messages and warnings. 
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
	echo = TRUE,
	message = FALSE,
	warning = FALSE,
	cache = TRUE
)

library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(sf)
library(mapview)

```

## Load data
Next we load our dataset from OpenDataPhilly.org. This dataset is a GeoJSON of all the parks in Philadelphia. We use sf::st_read() to read in spatial data like this.
```{r load data, include = FALSE}
parks <- st_read("https://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/d52445160ab14380a673e5849203eb64_0.geojson")
```

## Preview data
Let's preview our data. Using mapview::mapview(), we can quickly check what the data looks like. This is useful for when you are manipulating spatial data and need to check if things look right at each step.
```{r preview data}
mapview(parks, col.regions = "chartreuse3", map.types = "CartoDB.DarkMatter")
```
## Map the data
Finally, let's map using ggplot2. Add your name as a subtitle in the labs() function. Also feel free to change the colors and other aesthetics. Once you're satisfied, save and commit. 
```{r map data}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = parks, fill = "chartreuse4", color = "transparent") +
  labs(title = "Philadelphia Park System, 2023") + 
  theme_void()
```
